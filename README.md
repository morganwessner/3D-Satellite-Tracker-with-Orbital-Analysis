# 3D Satellite Tracker with Orbital Analysis 

This project is a 3D satellite tracking and analysis tool that takes in real-world orbital data (Two-Line Element sets) published by via Space-Track, propagates satellite orbits using SPG models, visualizes satellite motion around Earth in real time, and performs higher-level orbital analysis like close-approach detection and orbital decay prediction. 

At its core, this system transforms raw TLE data into meaningful position, velocity, and trajectory insights combining orbital mechanics with Python visualization and simulation techniques.

Currently this project is still in-progress...
